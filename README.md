# Damage Indicators Together
/ˈdæm.ætʒ ˈɪn.dɪ.keɪ.torz/

Such Red. Less Green. Much ouch. So Bääääm. WOW

### Damage Indicators are over 9000!!

(Oh yeah.. nearly forgot: get this mod to display cool fancy numbers on top of the heads of monsters you are just smashing)

### Configuration-Options:
* Only show damage: No heal.
* Display mode: 'Straight' for OCD-Version.
* Amount of numbers: Low for number-hell if you freeze.
* Decimal points: "1.3333", "1.3" or simply "1"
* Number size


#### This is the DST-version. This is *not* a client-only mod. It's a Server *and* Client mod.
