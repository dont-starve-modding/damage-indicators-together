# Damage Indicators Together
/ˈdæm.ætʒ ˈɪn.dɪ.keɪ.torz/

Such Red. Less Green. Much ouch. So Bääääm. WOW

### Damage Indicators are over 9000!!

(Oh yeah.. nearly forgot: get this mod to display cool fancy numbers on top of the heads of monsters you are just smashing)

### Configuration-Options:
* Only show damage: No heal.
* Display mode: 'Straight' for OCD-Version.
* Amount of numbers: Low for number-hell if you freeze.
* Decimal points: "1.3333", "1.3" or simply "1"
* Number size

#### This is the DST-version. This is *not* a client-only mod. It's a Server *and* Client mod.

Special thanks to DarkXero for porting this mod to DST! ([profile](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/user/537485-darkxero/]))

### FAQ

#### The numbers are too large. What can I do?
Change the settings "Number size" to "Tiny"

#### Something is not working as expected. Where can I submit an error?

#### Sometimes I see 0 or 0.0 when being healed or damaged. Is this correct?
It can happen that the actual value of healing or damage can be rounded down to 0. So you can assume that the dealt damage or applied healing is: |x| < 0.5
